Links
* Website Link: https://mad743.github.io/CN-Special-Force/
* Repository: https://github.com/MAD743/CN-Special-Force




Setup Process
1. Create a new Github repository that all members can access as collaborators.
2. Organize/create the website w/ HTML & CSS
3. Commit the HTML and CSS files to the repository
4. Set up the Github Pages, publishing the website based on the repository.




Challenges Faced:
* No significant challenge was faced, but minor issues existed
* The addition of a member caused an unknown connection error (recreated a new repository with a different setting to solve the issue)
* Setting up the GitHub page loaded too long (only initially)




Networking Principles/Protocols Applied:
* Internet Protocol(IP): 185.199.110.153
   * This protocol uses our website’s IP address for routing and addressing the data packets of our website to the Github Pages server.


* HTTPS: https://mad743.github.io/CN-Special-Force/
   * HTTPS utilizes encryption to keep the connections to our website secure.


* DNS: https://mad743.github.io/CN-Special-Force/
* DNS is applied to our website by translating its domain name into an IP address that allows web browser users to access our website with an easy-to-remember domain name rather than a complicated IP address.
