Repository: https://github.com/MAD743/CN-Special-Force


Setup Process
Create a new Github repository that all members can access as collaborators.
Organize/create the website w/ HTML & CSS
Commit the HTML, CSS, and Java files to the repository
Set up the Github Pages, publishing the website based on the repository.


Challenges Faced:
No significant challenge was faced, but minor issues existed
The addition of a member caused an unknown connection error (recreated a new repository with a different setting to solve the issue)
Setting up the GitHub page loaded too long (only initially)


Networking Principles/Protocols Applied:
Internet Protocol(IP): 185.199.110.153

HTTPS: https://mad743.github.io/CN-Special-Force/

DNS: none
DNS is only required if we use a custom domain. However, our site is currently accessed using GitHub’s subdomain (github.io), which is already managed by GitHub’s DNS system. Since we didn’t register a custom domain (paid), we don’t have any DNS records.
