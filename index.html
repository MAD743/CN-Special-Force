        <ul>
            <li>The domain github.io uses DNS to translate the website name into an IP address.</li>
            <li>IP provides a unique address to the server that our website is hosted on to allow clients to identify and connect to it.</li>
            <li>Our website uses the HTTPS protocol, which encrypts the messages it sends and ensures secure communication between client and server.</li>
